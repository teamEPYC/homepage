# Miden × Para: Making Privacy Usable Across Web3 and Beyond

Miden was built to prove that privacy and compliance can coexist. [Para](https://www.getpara.com/) now helps make that privacy accessible to everyone.

By integrating Para’s embedded wallet infrastructure, apps building on Miden can onboard users as with a Web3 or fintech app. There are not browser extensions, seed phrases, or crypto setup hurdles. Users can [sign in with](https://demo.getpara.com/?_gl=1*1304z6y*_ga*NzMyNTAzMjc1LjE3NTI4NTE4NzM.*_ga_J2BJTJZW8H*czE3NjIxOTcwMDkkbzExNiRnMSR0MTc2MjE5NzA0MyRqMjYkbDAkaDA.) email, SMS, or passkey and instantly have a secure, non-custodial wallet connected to Miden in the background.

Through its embedded wallet platform and distributed MPC authentication, Para is redefining how users interact with crypto. Its design embodies what we believe the future of crypto will look like: privacy-preserving, non-custodial, and effortless to use. Collaborating with Para strengthens Miden’s position as the home for builders who care about privacy, compliance, and user experience in equal measure.

This combination of Para’s seamless onboarding and Miden’s compliant privacy layer makes it possible to build user-first applications across DeFi, gaming, social, and institutional finance, all with privacy and compliance baked in by default.

## Why It Matters

**1\. Brings Frictionless Onboarding to Web3**

Para gives Miden developers a complete user stack that handles authentication, wallet creation, and [key management](https://docs.getpara.com/v2/concepts/key-management#key-management-system) behind the scenes. This means apps can onboard anyone instantly, whether they are Web3-native or entirely new to crypto. It removes one of the biggest barriers to adoption and helps the Miden ecosystem grow faster.

**2\. Aligns With Miden’s Compliant Privacy Vision**

Both Miden and Para are built around user control and security. Para’s [distributed MPC authentication](https://docs.getpara.com/v2/concepts/security#multi-party-computation-mpc) ensures users maintain full ownership of their keys, complementing Miden’s zero-knowledge execution model. Together, they provide a structure for compliance, privacy, and usability to coexist, setting the foundation for regulated applications to build with confidence.

**3\. Unlocks New Categories of Private Applications**

With simple onboarding and engrained privacy, developers can now build products that were previously difficult to deploy, including fintech and institutional apps that require privacy, identity, and auditability andreal-world asset and payments platforms that blend user ownership with regulatory alignment. 

This integration makes Miden a foundation for both Web3-native projects and the next generation of fintech experiences.

## Why Developers Should Care

Para removes the onboarding complexity that is typically responsible for UX friction and compromised growth. With Para, Miden developers can focus entirely on building their products while knowing that every user interaction, from login to transaction, is simple, private, and self-custodial.

## Summary

The integration of Miden and Para combines seamless onboarding with compliant privacy, bridging the gap between Web3 usability and institutional-grade security. It enables developers to build exciting applications that are private, user-owned, and ready for real-world adoption.
